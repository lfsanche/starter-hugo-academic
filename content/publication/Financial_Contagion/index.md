abstract: Financial contagion refers to the propagation of shocks that can generate widespread failures. We apply a financial contagion model proposed by Elliott et al. (2014) to a cross-shareholding network of firms in Ecuador. We use a novel dataset to study the potential channels for contagion. Although diversification is not high, results reveal enough conditions for a contagion event to occur. However, the low level of integration attenuates the effects of shocks. We run simulations affecting a particular firm at the time, and wefind that twofirms coming from the finance and trade industry cause the highest contagion. In addition, when an entire industry receives a shock, trade and manufacturing industries contagion more companies than the rest. Finally, the model can assist policymakers to monitor the market and evaluate the fragility of the network in different scenarios.
